# My Snake Game

## Description
This is my version of the 90s game Snake.

## Motive
I wanted to advance my skills in manipulating the DOM and improve my ability to tackle more demanding challenges.

## What I Learned
I learned how powerful modules are for keeping organized. I also learned to utilize a game loop and grid to create animations or games.
